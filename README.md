# Project: Responsive Design (with The Next Web)

Project to practice building a reponsive website (The Next Web) from The Odin Project's [Project: Responsive Design (with The Next Web).](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design)

The site uses media queries to degrade itself as the window size is reduced.
